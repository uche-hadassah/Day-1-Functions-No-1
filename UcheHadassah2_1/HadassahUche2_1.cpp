/*Write a function called factorial that takes a number n as a parameter and returns the 
factorial of that number. In mathematics, the factorial of a number n is defined as:
n! = n * ( n – 1 ) * ( n – 2 ) * … * 1 and 
0!=1
For example in your program, factorial(4) should return 24 (the value of 1*2*3*4), 
factorial(3) returns 6 (1*2*3). Write a program to test your function with user defined 
input and user friendly comments*/
